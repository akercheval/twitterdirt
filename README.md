### TwitterDirt
#### Gives you the juicy details you want to know about your twitter account

#### Use:
1. Download the repository
2. [Create a new application](https://apps.twitter.com/) that is in sync with your Twitter account
3. [Store](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34165172/tweepy-how-to-hide-api-key) your consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret in 
your shell as `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_SECRET`,
respectively.
4. Run `python3 twitterdirt.py`. The program has to first initialize a list of all
your followers. Every time after that that you run the function, it will tell you
which accounts don't follow you back, and which accounts followed and unfollowed you
since the last time you checked! It's a blast. Go ahead and be petty as hell with
the information you learn.
